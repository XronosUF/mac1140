\maketitle

Simply put, the goal of this course is to prepare one for Calculus (MAC2311) and further math courses, with the exception of trigonometry content. \\

More conceptually however, the real goal of this course is to teach how to problem solve and use mathematical reasoning in an outside setting. Often the process of modeling and reasoning are devalued or even sacrificed entirely in an effort to teach the mechanical skills of arithmetic. This is typically met with exasperation and confusion by students who ask "What's the point of learning this?", which is a valid question in any classroom. Unfortunately the point of learning mathematics is not the computation aspect, but the reasoning and modelings aspects... those very things that are often pushed out in an effort to improve the more easily assessed computational skills. So, a more simply put, if far less simple, answer, is "The goal of this course is to teach you to 'think'."
