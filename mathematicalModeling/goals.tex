    This section is on learning to use mathematics to model real-life situations.

\maketitle
By the end of this section students should be able to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Have an understanding of what a mathematical model is.
    \item Know the benefits (and weaknesses) of mathematical models.
    \item Be familiar with a basic approach to building a generalize mathematical model.
    \item Know (and understand) the types and roles of variables in mathematics.
    \item Produce a generalized model given minimal initial information.
\end{itemize}

Questions we aim to answer...

\begin{itemize}
    \item What is Mathematical Reasoning?
    \item How do you tell what is important and what is extraneous information?
    \item Why are Models useful?
    \item How does this apply outside of a classroom?
    \item When should you extend to a model, and when should you not?
    \item What is the virtue of generalizing?
    \item Can you generalize a generalization?
\end{itemize}
