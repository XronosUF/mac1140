By the end of this section students should be able to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Know what it means to `grow exponentially' and identify when things grow exponentially or not.
    \item Calculate the `growth multiplier' and use it to create a correct exponential growth formula.
    \item Utilize an exponential growth formula to determine the result of exponential growth or decay after a given time period.
    \item Understand the differences (and similarities) of exponential growth and decay; specifically to be able to explain the mathematical difference as well as the conceptual difference.
    \item Solve for unknowns in exponents in an equality.
    \item Know and utilize the properties of exponents to simplify or expand exponentials as necessary.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item What \textit{are} exponents?
    \item How do we interpret negative exponents?
    \item How do we interpret fractional exponents?
    \item What kind of models use exponents?
\end{itemize}
